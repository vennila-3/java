Object-oriented programming generally referred to as OOPS is the backbone of java

-----------------------------------   Method  ------------------------------------------------
    The method in Java or Methods of Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. 
    A Java method can perform some specific task without returning anything. 
    A method is like a function used to expose the behavior of an object.
    It is a set of codes that perform a particular task.

Advantage of Method
   Code Reusability
   Code Optimization 
Types of method:
   predefine method
   uder define method

-----------------------------------------------   ACCESS MODIFIERS  --------------------------------------------------
Access modifiers help to restrict the scope of a class, constructor, variable, method, or data member. 
It provides security, accessibility, etc to the user depending upon the access modifier used with the element.

              Types of Access Modifiers in Java
                  Default – No keyword required
                  Private
                  Protected
                  Public
DEFAULT:
        having default access modifiers are accessible only within the same package.
          // Java program to illustrate default modifier 
          package p1; 
        // Class Geek is having Default access modifier 
        class Geek 
         { 
	    void display() 
	   { 
		System.out.println("Hello World!"); 
	   } 
       }

PRIVATE:
  The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.
  Any other class of the same package will not be able to access these members.
***  Top-level classes or interfaces can not be declared as private because private means “only visible within the enclosing class”.
  protected means “only visible within the enclosing class and any subclasses”.

PROTECTED
    The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
    In this example, we will create two packages p1 and p2. Class A in p1 is made public, to access it in p2. The method display in class A
    is protected and class B is inherited from class A and this protected method is then accessed by creating an object of class B.

Public Access modifier
     The public access modifier has the widest scope among all other access modifiers.
     Classes, methods, or data members that are declared as public are accessible from everywhere in the program.
    There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.

------------------------------------  CONSTRUCTOR  ----------------------------------------------
 A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
 The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. 
 It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
     TYPES:
Default Constructor  -
        Default constructor provides the default values to the object like 0, null, etc. depending on the type.
        A constructor that has no parameters is known as default the constructor. 
        A default constructor is invisible. And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor.
Parameterized Constructor  -
         If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.
Copy Constructor
         copy constructor is passed with another object which copies the data available from the passed object to the newly created object.

------------------------------------------ PILLERS ---------------------------------------

These concepts aim to implement real-world entities in programs.

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism.
